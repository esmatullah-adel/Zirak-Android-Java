Key Features:

Deposit: When customer brings cash to company for depositing, the system should deposit the money in the customer account. In deposit the system will show the related customer photo in order to reduce entry mistakes.

Withdraw: When customer tries to withdraw back their deposited money. Before withdrawing the system should make sure the customer has enough money to withdraw.

Transfer: Sometimes a customer needs to transfer money to a different city or even country. The system does the transfer with some charges maybe being applied on customer’s money. The system should be able to transfer same currency or different currency. 
The transfer process is itself divided into two parts: 
a.	local transfer b. foreign transfer. Each has its unique attributes. 
The user can create new transfer, edit the previous one, delete unwanted transfer or export a list of transfers in pdf, excel, etc…

Receive: This process is used in accordance to the transfer. When cash is transferred from another MSP company to your company, so you use this Receive process. In this process customer which is receiver here receives his/her cash. The system must be able to give same or different currency to the receiver. 
The Receive process is also divided into two parts: 
a.	Local Receive b. Foreign Receive. Each has its unique attributes. 
For increasing the speed of entry the system will be able to import the records from excel.

Transfer from Account to Account: Sometimes it is required to directly transfer credit from account of one customer to account of another. This is a single process used instead of first Withdraw then Deposit process. For instance, when Ahmad wants to transfer 5,000 Turkish Liras from his account to Ajmal’s account first it is required to withdraw this amount of money from Ahmad’s account and then deposit it to Ajmal’s account but instead of these two isolated processes the system directly transfers this amount from Ahmad’s account to Ajmal’s account which is called Transfer from Account to Account.
For the better performance and simplicity, the system should allow either same currency or different currency to be transferred from account to account. If the currencies are different the exchange should be done in the same form rather than doing an isolated exchange.

Exchange: It is one of the main functionalities of this system which allows customers to exchange their money. For increasing the entry speed the system should automatically load the latest same exchange rate for the new records and should be editable. The user will be able to create, edit, delete exchange records and print the summary of daily exchanges in order to have the benefits made from exchanges.

Expense: As we know that every company has its own expenses, so the system must be able to save daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly expenses. For the better management of expenses this system divides expenses in different categories. And is also possible to report every expense to the shareholders if required.

Bank Transactions: Currency Exchange & MSP companies using business bank accounts for some of their transactions, so the system will have a separate section for managing these kinds of transactions.

Different Reports: The system will have different types of reports such is customer transactions report, gross benefits report, net benefits report, asset report, owner balance report, till report, expense report, etc… The users can generate reports, print reports or export reports and share it with the customers or shareholders. Reports can be in graphs or in a table view format.
In customer reports the system will generate separated reports for each account of the customer and a single report for all accounts of the customer.
In asset report the system should allow user to print report in any desired currency, and in daily, weekly, or yearly basis.
The system will be able to generate different types of benefit report such as charges benefit report, exchange benefit report, rates benefit report, etc…

User management: For different levels of users the system will have different types of users with different authorities assigned to them. The system can create new users, edit the previous users or disable any inactive user.
